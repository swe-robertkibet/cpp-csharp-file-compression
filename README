suggested pseudocode for RLE compression

```cpp
function compressRLE(inputFile, outputFile):
    open inputFile for reading
    open outputFile for writing
    currentChar = None
    count = 0

    for char in inputFile:
        if char == currentChar:
            count += 1
        else:
            if currentChar is not None:
                write (count, currentChar) to outputFile
            currentChar = char
            count = 1

    write (count, currentChar) to outputFile
    close files

function decompressRLE(inputFile, outputFile):
    open inputFile for reading
    open outputFile for writing

    while not end of inputFile:
        read count, char
        write char repeated count times to outputFile

    close files
```
