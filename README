suggested pseudocode for RLE compression

```cpp
function compressRLE(inputFile, outputFile):
    open inputFile for reading
    open outputFile for writing
    currentChar = None
    count = 0

    for char in inputFile:
        if char == currentChar:
            count += 1
        else:
            if currentChar is not None:
                write (count, currentChar) to outputFile
            currentChar = char
            count = 1

    write (count, currentChar) to outputFile
    close files

function decompressRLE(inputFile, outputFile):
    open inputFile for reading
    open outputFile for writing

    while not end of inputFile:
        read count, char
        write char repeated count times to outputFile

    close files
```

suggested psudocode for huffman coding

```cpp
function buildFrequencyTable(inputFile):
    freq = empty map
    for char in inputFile:
        freq[char] += 1
    return freq

function buildHuffmanTree(freq):
    create priority queue pq
    for each char, count in freq:
        create node and push to pq

    while pq.size > 1:
        left = pq.pop()
        right = pq.pop()
        newNode = Node(left + right)  # sum of frequencies
        pq.push(newNode)

    return pq.pop()  # root node

function generateCodes(node, prefix="", codeMap={}):
    if node is leaf:
        codeMap[node.char] = prefix
    else:
        generateCodes(node.left, prefix + "0", codeMap)
        generateCodes(node.right, prefix + "1", codeMap)
    return codeMap

function compressHuffman(inputFile, outputFile):
    freq = buildFrequencyTable(inputFile)
    root = buildHuffmanTree(freq)
    codeMap = generateCodes(root)
    write codeMap to outputFile
    for char in inputFile:
        write codeMap[char] bits to outputFile

    read codeMap from inputFile
    currentBits = ""
    while not end of inputFile:
        currentBits += read next bit

```cpp

    for char in inputFile:

        else:

            add stringPlusChar to dict with next available code
            string = char
    write dict[string] to outputFile

function decompressLZW(inputFile, outputFile):

    prevCode = read next code from inputFile
    write dict[prevCode] to outputFile

        write entry to outputFile

        prevCode = code
